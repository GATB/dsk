Dear reviewers,

Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions regarding our manuscript. Please find below an overview of the modifications made in response to the reviews.

Indeed, if D is limited (i.e. bounded by a constant), the algorithm becomes quadratic. However, as long as D=O(v) (not necessarily D=v, but (v/10) works too), the algorithm remains linear-time. Furthermore, the special case (n_i = 1) is important but not the single useful one: in our experience with human genome k-mer counting, we typically end up with n_i in 3..10 (depending on available disk space) and the algorithm remains practical.

As the paragraph discussing this aspect was perhaps unclear, we changed the D=omega(v) notation to D=Theta(v) as the latter is more widely known. Setting D much larger than v has no benefit. Also, we changed the sentence "setting D equal to the reads file size" to "setting D equal to the sum of input bases" as the reviewer pointed that it was unclear.

We agree the lack of random access to kmer counts make dsk different to jellyfish and BFcounter, and should be noted in the manuscript. We added a sentence about that in the Discussion.

This is a very relevant remark. Due to lack of space, we could not cite in this article some methods (mostly assembly) that benefit from efficient k-mer counting. However, we added at the end of the abstract that DSK can replace a popular k-mer counting software (Jellyfish) on small-memory servers. As a direct response to the reviewer question, DSK is used in the low-memory assembly method Minia (http://minia.genouest.org).

2)
We added in the Introduction that BFCounter is a kmer-counting method based on a Bloom filter.

Thank you, we corrected these typos as suggested.

Thank you, we made all the suggested corrections.

4)
We corrected the compilation warnings. The software now compiles on Mac OS X 10.8.2 by passing a parameter to the makefile 'make osx=1'.
